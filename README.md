Asulton or Air Pressure System (APS) Sensor Fault Detection is an end-to-end machine learning project.
The main goal of this project is to reduce the cost due to unnecessary repairs. So it is required to minimize false predictions. This is a Binary Classification problem, in which the affirmative class indicates that the failure was caused by a certain component of the APS, while the negative class indicates that the failure was caused by something else.
